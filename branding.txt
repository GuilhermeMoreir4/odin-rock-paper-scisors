We need to do the rock,paper scisors game.

Program flow:
    -User input;
    -Computer input (maybe an array with 3 numbers);
    -Compare user input with the computer input; -> Wich is the best solution ? I don't need a lot of string comparison
    -Game Loop, around five rounds and display the winner;
